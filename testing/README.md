WIP

Testing folder will contain a python module that tests payment_engine and reports... When I get to doing that...

This module would print a test report detailing which methods failed etc and contain expansive tests for PaymentEngine object

In this directory are some input files used to test. The same file was edited so they don't reflect all the testing done
